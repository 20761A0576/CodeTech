*DESCRIPTION* :
AI chatbot integration involves embedding an intelligent conversational agent into an ASP.NET Core application using Azure Bot Service. This process includes setting up a bot in the Azure portal, developing the bot logic using the Bot Framework SDK, and connecting it to communication channels like a web app or Microsoft Teams. The chatbot can handle user queries, provide automated responses, and integrate with external APIs for enhanced functionality. The integration requires configuring authentication, deploying the bot, and ensuring secure communication. The final deliverable is a fully functional web application with chatbot capabilities, enhancing user engagement and support automation.
